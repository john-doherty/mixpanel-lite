# mixpanel-lite

[![Build Status](https://github.com/john-doherty/mixpanel-lite/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/john-doherty/mixpanel-lite/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A lightweight _(2.9k)_ alternative to [mixpanel-js](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js) with offline support for Hybrid and Progressive Web Apps.

Events are written to localStorage first and are only removed once the Mixpanel [HTTP API](https://developer.mixpanel.com/docs/http) confirms receipt, thus allowing the device to go offline without losing events.

## Usage

Add [mixpanel-lite.min.js](dist/mixpanel-lite.min.js) to your project:

```html
<script src="mixpanel-lite.min.js"></script>
```

At present only the following methods are supported:

```js
// setup mixpanel
mixpanel.init('your-token-here'); // pass { mute: true } to mute by default

// assign all future events to a user
mixpanel.identify('user@email.com');

// register 'Gender' as a super property
mixpanel.register({'Gender': 'Female'});

// assign user info
mixpanel.people.set({
    $email: 'user@email.com' // only special properties need the $
});

// track an event
mixpanel.track('Your Event Name' {
    firstName: 'Optional event property 1',
    lastName: 'Optional event property 2'
});

// get super property
mixpanel.getProperty('distinct_id');

// clear current identity
mixpanel.reset();

// stop sending data to mixpanel (calls to track, identify etc are ignored)
mixpanel.mute();

// resume sending data to mixpanel
mixpanel.unmute();

// check if mixpanel is muted
if (mixpanel.muted) {
    console.log('Mixpanel is disabled');
}
```

### Additional tracking properties

**mixpanel-lite** adds additional properties to each tracking event:

Name        | Type      | Description
:-----------|:----------|:---------------------------------------------------
`offline`   | `boolean` | `true` if event captured when offline
`automated` | `boolean` | `true` if event captured using an automated browser
`dev`       | `boolean` | `true` if event captured when running locally
`ad`        | `object`  | object containing online ad click ids
`utm`       | `object`  | object containing UTM tracking values
